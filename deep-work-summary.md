# Deep Work (summary)

## Introduction
### The two kinds of work:

> **Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

> **Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

## Chapter 1: Deep Work is Valuable
Among various forces at play, it’s the rise of digital technology in particular that’s transforming our labor markets in unexpected ways. “We are in the early throes of a GreatRestructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.”

This Great Restructuring is not driving down all jobs but is instead dividing them. Though an increasing number of people will lose in this new economy as their skill becomes automatable or easily outsourced, there are others who will not only survive, but thrive—becoming more valued (and therefore more rewarded) than before.

They proceed to identify three specific groups that will fall on the lucrative side of this divide and reap a disproportionate amount of the benefits of the Intelligent Machine Age.
1. The High-Skilled Workers: those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive.Tyler Cowen summarizes this reality more bluntly: “The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?”

2. The Superstars
    - Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer.
    - In a seminal 1981 paper, the economist Sherwin Rosen worked out the mathematics behind these “winner-take-all” markets. One of his key insights was to explicitly model talent—labeled, innocuously, with the variable q in his formulas—as a factor with “imperfect substitution,” which Rosen explains as follows: “Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.”
   - Therefore, if you’re in a marketplace where the consumer has access to all performers,and everyone’s q value is clear, the consumer will choose the very best. 

3. The Owners
Those with capital to invest in the new technologies that are driving the Great Restructuring. 

### Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:
   1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
   2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. This provides another general observation for joining the ranks of winners in our economy: If you don’t produce,you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.

> The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.

### Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things
>“Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.” - Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges

To master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice—there are few exceptions made for natural talent.(On this point too, Sertillanges seems to have been ahead of his time, arguing in The Intellectual Life, “Men of genius themselves were great only by bringing all their power to bear on the point on which they had decided to show their full measure.”

This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows:
1. your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master;
2. you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. 

>“Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the focused attention required by deliberate practice”

Neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people's improvements on hard tasks. These scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain circuits. This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated.

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill.

The reason, therefore,why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.
If you’re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strengthen.

### Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level
Though Grant’s productivity depends on many factors,there’s one idea in particular that seems central to his method:the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long,uninterrupted stretches.
- Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during which he can turn all of his attention to teaching well and being available to his students. (This method seems to work, as Grant is currently the highest-rated teacher at Wharton and the winner of multiple teaching awards.) By batching his teaching in the fall, Grant can then turn his attention fully to research in the spring and summer, and tackle this work with less distraction.
- Grant also batches his attention on a smaller time scale.Within a semester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to students and colleagues, and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research task.
- To Grant, it’s important to enforce strict isolation until he completes the task at hand.

>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) $x$ (Intensity of Focus)

Leroy introduced an effect she called **attention residue**.
- The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.
- This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.
- “People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.
- By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, allowing him to maximize performance on this one task.

The attention residue concept is still telling because it implies that the common habit of working in a state of semi-distraction is potentially devastating to your performance. It might seem harmless to take a quick glance at your inbox every ten minutes or so. Indeed, many justify this behavior as better than the old practice of leaving an inbox open on the screen at all times (a straw-man habit that few follow anymore). But Leroy teaches us that this is not in fact much of an improvement. That quick check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse, by seeing messages that you cannot deal with at the moment (which is almost always the case), you’ll be forced to turn back to the primary task with a secondary task left unfinished. The attention residue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.

To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. The type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.

#### If deep work is so important,why are there distracted people who do well?
The necessity of distraction in these executives’ work lives is highly specific to their particular jobs.
- They have built up a hard-won repository of experience and have honed and proved an instinct for their market. They’re then presented inputs throughout the day—in the form of e-mails, meetings, site visits, and the like—that they must process and act on.
- To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It’s better to hire three smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring their solutions to the executive for a final decision.
- you cannot extrapolate the approach of these executives to other jobs.

## Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare
### The Metric Black Hole
The impact of deep work is difficult to measure. Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts. The French economist Thomas Piketty made this point explicit in his study of the extreme growth of executive salaries. The enabling assumption driving his argument is that “it is objectively difficult to measure individual contributions to a firm’s output.” In the absence of such measures, irrational outcomes, such as executive salaries way out of proportion to the executive’s marginal productivity, can occur. Even though some details of Piketty’s theory are controversial, the underlying assumption that it’s increasingly difficult to measure individuals’ contributions is generally considered, to quote one of his critics, “undoubtedly true.”

### The Principle of Least Resistance

You might argue—as many do—that this (culture of connectivity) is necessary in many fast-paced businesses. But here’s where things get interesting: Perlow tested this claim. In more detail, she convinced executives at the Boston Consulting Group, a high-pressure management consulting firm with an ingrained culture of connectivity, to let her fiddle with the work habits of one of their teams. She wanted to test a simple question: Does it really help your work to be constantly connected? To do so, she did something extreme: She forced each member of the team to take one day out of the workweek completely off—no connectivity to anyone inside or outside the company.“At first, the team resisted the experiment,” she recalled about one of the trials. “The partner in charge, who had been very supportive of the basic idea, was suddenly nervous about having to tell her client that each member of her team would be off one day a week.” The consultants were equally nervous and worried that they were “putting their careers in jeopardy.”But the team didn’t lose their clients and its members did not lose their jobs. Instead, the consultants found more enjoyment in their work, better communication among themselves, more learning (as we might have predicted, given the connection between depth and skill development highlighted in the last chapter), and perhaps most important, “a better product delivered to the client.”

>**The Principle of Least Resistance**: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we willt end toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier. There are at least two big reasons why this is true. The first concerns responsiveness to your needs. If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier—at least, in the moment. If you couldn’t count on this quick response time you’d instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized,and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you requested. All of this would make the day to day of your working life harder (even if it produced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the long term). The rise of professional instant messaging,mentioned earlier in this chapter, can be seen as this mind-set pushed toward an extreme. If receiving an e-mail reply within an hour makes your day easier, then getting an answer via instant message in under a minute would improve this gain by an order of magnitude.

(David Allen’s Getting Things Done task-management methodology, which is a well-respected system for intelligently managing competing workplace obligations. This system proposes a fifteen-element flowchart for making a decision on what to do next!)

The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning,at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value. By doing so, this principle drives us toward shallow work in an economy that increasingly rewards depth.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity
>"To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time… it needs a lot of concentration… if you have a job administrating anything, you don’t have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I’m irresponsible. I’m actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don’t do anything. If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, “no,” I tell them: I’m irresponsible."

>**Busyness as Proxy for Productivity**: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that’s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it. 

We could, of course, eliminate this anachronistic commitment to busyness if we could easily demonstrate its negative impact on the bottom line, but the metric black hole enters the scene at this point and prevents such clarity.

### Bad for Business. Good for You.

Our culture has developed a belief that if a behavior relates to “the Internet,” then it’s good—regardless of its impact on our ability to produce valuable things. All of these trends are enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or the cost of ignoring it.

## Chapter 3: Deep Work Is Meaningful

“The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy,” explains Matthew Crawford. And we believe him.

Craftsmen tackle professional challenges that are simple to define but difficult to execute—a useful imbalance when seeking purpose. Knowledge work exchanges this clarity for ambiguity. Itcan be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another: On our worst days, it can seem that all knowledge work boils down to the same exhausting roil of e-mails and PowerPoint, with only the charts used in the slides differentiating one career from another. 

A deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.

### A Neurological Argument for Depth

The skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.
We tend to place a lot of emphasis on our circumstances, assuming that what happens to us (or fails to happen) determines how we feel. From this perspective,the small-scale details of how you spend your day aren’t that important, because what matters are the large-scale outcomes,such as whether or not you get a promotion or move to that nicer apartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to.

“Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”

After a bad or disrupting occurrence in your life, Fredrickson’s research shows, what you choose to focus on exerts significant leverage on your attitude going forward.

This seems like a simple exhortation to look on the bright side, but Fredrickson found that skillful use of these emotional “leverage points” can generate a significantly more positive outcome after negative events.

By skillfully managing their attention,they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.

There is, however, a hidden but equally important benefit to cultivating rapt attention in your workday: Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives.

He emphasizes the advantage of cultivating “concentration so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems.”

"Five years of reporting on attention have confirmed some truths.

These efforts consisted primarily of deep work—but a type of deep work we haven’t yetencountered. Brattain would concentrate intensely to engineeran experimental design that could exploit Bardeen’s latest theoretical insight; then Bardeen would concentrate intensely tomake sense of what Brattain’s latest experiments revealed, trying to expand his theoretical framework to match the observations. This back-and-forth represents a collaborative form ofdeep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what Icall the whiteboard effect. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard canpush you deeper than if you were working alone. The presenceof the other party waiting for your next insight—be it someonephysically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth.

Lag measuresdescribe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve.

unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt to understand the different roles consciousand unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a highlevel, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. Forexample, if you need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involvelarge amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhapseven conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue. UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the factthat these regions of your brain have more neuronal bandwidthavailable, allowing them to move around more information andsift through more potential solutions than your conscious centersof thinking.

Walking through nature, by contrast, exposes you to whatlead author Marc Berman calls “inherently fascinating stimuli,”using sunsets as an example. These stimuli “invoke attentionmodestly, allowing focused-attention mechanisms a chance to replenish.” Put another way, when walking through nature, you’refreed from having to direct your attention, as there are few challenges to navigate (like crowded street crossings), and experienceenough interesting stimuli to keep your mind sufficiently occupied to avoid the need to actively aim your attention.

What’s important to our purpose is observing that the implications of ART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The coremechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore yourability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can anynumber of relaxing activities so long as they provide similar “inherently fascinating stimuli” and freedom from directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening tomusic while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run—the types of activities that will fill your time in theevening if you enforce a work shutdown—play the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature.

Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategyis to support your commitment to shutting down with a strictshutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or projecthas been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed thateither (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’scaptured in a place where it will be revisited when the time isright. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps youalways conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have aset phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds cheesy,but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to releasework-related thoughts for the rest of the day.

The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. Thiseffect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes theability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention.

From my experience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habitsticks—that is, until your mind trusts your ritual enough to actually begin to release work-related thoughts in the evening. Butonce it does stick, the ritual will become a permanent fixture inyour life—to the point that skipping the routine will fill you witha sense of unease.

If it’s possible, switch to another offline activity for the remainder of thecurrent block (or perhaps even fill in this time relaxing). If thisis infeasible—perhaps you need to get the current offline activity done promptly—then the correct response is to change yourschedule so that your next Internet block begins sooner. The keyin making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet block to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap between the current moment and the next time youcan go online. This gap is minor, so it won’t excessively impedeyour progress, but from a behavioralist perspective, it’s substantial because it separates the sensation of wanting to go onlinefrom the reward of actually doing so.

Roediger andhis collaborators sent a team, equipped with a battery of cognitive tests, to the Extreme Memory Tournament held in SanDiego. They wanted to understand what differentiated theseelite memorizers from the population at large. “We found thatone of the biggest differences between memory athletes and therest of us is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure ofmemory at all but of attention,” explained Roediger in a NewYork Times blog post (emphasis mine). The ability in question iscalled “attentional control,” and it measures the subjects’ abilityto maintain their focus on essential information.

The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to itsuse, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.The problem with this approach, of course, is that it ignores all the negatives that come along with the tools in question.

Here’s my suggestion: At the beginning of each workday,turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate tothis purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark everyother line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hoursyou typically work. Now comes the important part: Divide thehours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to theblocks. For example, you might block off nine a.m. to eleven a.m. for writing a client’s press release. To do so, actually drawa box that covers the lines corresponding to these hours, thenwrite “press release” inside the box. Not every block need bededicated to a work task. There might be time blocks for lunchor relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one lineon your page). This means, for example, that instead of having aunique small box for each small task on your plate for the day—respond to boss’s e-mail, submit reimbursement form, ask Carlabout report—you can batch similar things into more generictask blocks. You might find it useful, in this case, to draw a linefrom a task block to the open right-hand side of the page whereyou can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplishin that block.

This question is meant as a thought experiment (I’m not going to ask you to actually hire a recent college graduate to takeover tasks that score low). But the answers it provides will helpyou objectively quantify the shallowness or depth of variousactivities. If our hypothetical college graduate requires manymonths of training to replicate a task, then this indicates that thetask leverages hard-won expertise. As argued earlier, tasks thatleverage your expertise tend to be deep tasks and they can therefore provide a double benefit: They return more value per timespent, and they stretch your abilities, leading to improvement.On the other hand, a task that our hypothetical college graduatecan pick up quickly is one that does not leverage expertise, andtherefore it can be understood as shallow.

Another tactic that works well for me is to be clear in my refusal butambiguous in my explanation for the refusal. The key is to avoidproviding enough specificity about the excuse that the requesterhas the opportunity to defuse it. If, for example, I turn down atime-consuming speaking invitation with the excuse that I haveother trips scheduled for around the same time, I don’t providedetails—which might leave the requester the ability to suggesta way to fit his or her event into my existing obligations—butinstead just say, “Sounds interesting, but I can’t make it due toschedule conflicts.” In turning down obligations, I also resist theurge to offer a consolation prize that ends up devouring almostas much of my schedule (e.g., “Sorry I can’t join your committee,but I’m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as theycome together and offer my thoughts”).

The notion thatall messages, regardless of purpose or sender, arrive in thesame undifferentiated inbox, and that there’s an expectationthat every message deserves a (timely) response, is absurdly unproductive. The sender filter is a small but useful step towarda better state of affairs, and is an idea whose time has come—at least for the increasing number of entrepreneurs and freelancers who both receive a lot of incoming communication andhave the ability to dictate their accessibility. (I’d also love to seesimilar rules become ubiquitous for intra-office communicationin large organizations, but for the reasons argued in Chapter 2,we’re probably a long way from that reality.) If you’re in a position to do so, consider sender filters as a way of reclaiming somecontrol over your time and attention.

The process-centric approach to e-mail can significantlymitigate the impact of this technology on your time and attention. There are two reasons for this effect. First, it reducesthe number of e-mails in your inbox—sometimes significantly(something as simple as scheduling a coffee meeting can easilyspiral into half a dozen or more messages over a period of manydays, if you’re not careful about your replies). This, in turn, reduces the time you spend in your inbox and reduces the brainpower you must expend when you do.Second, to steal terminology from David Allen, a goodprocess-centric message immediately “closes the loop” with respect to the project at hand. When a project is initiated by ane-mail that you send or receive, it squats in your mental landscape—becoming something that’s “on your plate” in the sensethat it has been brought to your attention and eventually needsto be addressed. This method closes this open loop as soon as itforms.
